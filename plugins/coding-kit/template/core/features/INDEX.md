# {{PROJECT_NAME}} — Features

<!-- section:index-head -->
Every task is a feature with an F-number and one file `F-NNN-short-name.md` in this
folder. The file grows over the feature's whole life — intake, specification, plan,
history — and is never moved; `F-000-template.md` is the template. This index is the
short overview: the recommended order, then the table of all features. Entries are
written in {{LANG_LIVING_DOCS}}; field names and status tokens stay English.

- **Title:** at most 70 characters, the same in the file and the table. It says what
  changes — not how, not why, no result report; no status, no version, no list in
  brackets. A "merged into" belongs to the status. The file name stays when the title
  changes.
- **Recommended order:** written by hand, with the date of its last revision. Only open
  features, each with a half-sentence reason; strands are fine. Revised on request at any
  time; `/add-feature`, `/prep-step` and `/step-done` propose changes, a larger
  replanning belongs to `/refine-requirements`.
- **Table of all features:** generated from the header blocks of the files by
  `just features-index` — never edit it by hand. `just check` reports a stale table.
- **next-feature:** the number the next new feature gets.

| Status | Meaning | Set by |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `BACKLOG` | captured, not yet specified | `/add-feature` |
| `PLANNED` | specification and plan approved, ready to build | `/prep-step` |
| `IN-PROGRESS` | first substep booked | `/step-done` |
| `DONE` | everything booked, every acceptance criterion proven; final — follow-up work gets a new number | `/step-done` |
| `DROPPED` | deliberately not, or no further, implemented; the reason is in the file | `/add-feature`, `/prep-step`, `/refine-requirements` |
| `SUPERSEDED` | merged into or split across other features (`superseded-by`) | `/prep-step`, `/refine-requirements` |

The way through: `BACKLOG` → `PLANNED` → `IN-PROGRESS` → `DONE`; a small feature without
substeps goes from `PLANNED` straight to `DONE`. Every open status can end in `DROPPED`
or `SUPERSEDED`. Both keep their file and number, so a returning idea is found together
with its reasons.
