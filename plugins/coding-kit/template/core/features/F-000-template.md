# F-000 — Short title of the change

<!-- Copy this file to F-NNN-short-name.md: the number from `next-feature` in INDEX.md,
the short name from the title (lowercase ASCII, hyphens, about 40 characters), fixed once
created. Headings and text are written in the language of the living docs; field names
and status tokens stay English. The hints in HTML comments go once a section is filled.

Header block: plain `key: value` lines only — no quotes; lists comma-separated.
- title: at most 70 characters; says what changes (rules in INDEX.md)
- type: feature (new behaviour) | fix (wrong behaviour) | change (rework, docs, upkeep,
  audit); it decides the goal line below, the number stays F-NNN
- status: BACKLOG | PLANNED | IN-PROGRESS | DONE | DROPPED | SUPERSEDED (INDEX.md)
- size: S | M | L, set by /prep-step
- done: the date for DONE, also for DROPPED and SUPERSEDED; empty while open
- depends-on, superseded-by: F-numbers; superseded-by only for SUPERSEDED
After a change to the header block, `just features-index` regenerates the table. -->

## Intake

<!-- /add-feature. The problem comes first: a solution brought along is an option, not
an order. -->

**Problem:** <!-- what is missing or wrong, and why it matters; 1–3 sentences -->

**Goal:** <!-- feature: "As <role> I want <…>, so that <…>" · fix: actual behaviour,
expected behaviour, how to reproduce · change: the goal and what must stay the same -->

**Solution sketch:** <!-- non-binding direction, a few bullets -->

**Dependencies:** <!-- F-numbers, or none -->

**Still to analyse:** <!-- optional -->

## Specification

<!-- /prep-step, phase 1. Depth by size — S: 1–3 criteria, edge cases "none" or 1–2,
no interview. M: criteria with a negative case, 3–5 edge cases, 1–3 non-goals, a test
per criterion. L: the full interview with example mapping, systematic edge cases (data,
states, errors, security, migration), non-goals required, a test strategy. -->

### Acceptance criteria

<!-- AC-n as Given/When/Then, negative cases included. Checked off at the finish, with
the proof in the same line: "— proof: test …" or "— proof: just check". -->

- [ ] AC-1 — Given …, when …, then …

### Edge cases

- EC-1 — <situation> → <expected behaviour>

### Non-goals

- … <!-- with → F-NNN when another feature covers it -->

### Tests

- AC-1 → <!-- automated test, check, or manual: how -->

### Embedding

<!-- What the feature touches and what must change with it; what the request silently
assumes (a way back, migration, error message, permission); conflicts with the goals,
non-goals and ADRs; follow-up F-numbers. -->

### Open questions

- [ ] [CLARIFY] … <!-- a blocking one keeps the feature from PLANNED -->

### Decisions

- YYYY-MM-DD — <!-- X instead of Y, because …; when the user overrules a
  recommendation, say so: "recommendation was Z; chose X, because …" -->

## Plan

<!-- /prep-step, phase 2. -->

**Size:** <!-- S | M | L and one sentence why: effort (S under 5 files and 200 lines, M
up to 15 and 500, L above), uncertainty and reach — the highest signal counts -->

**Approach:** <!-- the way chosen; from M on, at least one alternative and why not -->

### F-000a — <!-- substep name -->

<!-- What, which parts, which criteria it fulfils. S: plan in bullets, no substeps;
M: 2–3 substeps; L: 3–5, a spike first when uncertainty is high. -->

## History

<!-- /step-done, one entry per substep, oldest first. -->

### F-000a — done YYYY-MM-DD

**Implemented:** <!-- what was built and how it works, with the important places — not
every file, the commit has the list -->

**Decisions:** <!-- what was decided and why, the user's decisions included -->

**Deviation from plan:** <!-- what and why, or none -->

**Findings:** <!-- → F-NNN -->
