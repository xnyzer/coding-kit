# How to Code with Claude

Guide for working with Claude Code in the {{PROJECT_NAME}} project.

---

## Contributor setup

1. **Install Claude Code** — see the [official docs](https://code.claude.com/docs).
2. **Install the coding-kit plugin** (provides the workflow skills used below):
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add xnyzer/coding-kit
   /plugin install coding-kit@xnyzer
   ```
3. **Install the toolchain** — [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) provides everything pinned in
   `mise.toml` (including `just`, `lefthook`, `gitleaks` and the stack toolchain):
   ```
   mise install
   just setup     # dependencies + git hooks
   just check     # must be green
   ```
4. *(Optional)* **Graphiti memory** — if a Graphiti MCP server is configured, the project
   uses the group id documented in `CLAUDE.md`. Without one, the skills skip it silently.

## Overview: skills

None of these skills live in this repository — they come from the coding-kit plugin for
Claude Code (see *Contributor setup*). Each can be called with the plugin's namespace,
e.g. `/coding-kit:add-feature`; the short form `/add-feature` used below works as long as
no other command or skill has the same name. The skills automate a workflow you can also
follow by hand: the feature files in `features/` and the `just` recipes (`just check`
above all) work without the plugin.

**Daily development loop** — a feature moves `BACKLOG → PLANNED → IN-PROGRESS → DONE`
(statuses and their meaning: the head of `features/INDEX.md`):

| Skill | When to use | What happens |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `/add-feature` | Put a new task on the roadmap — you start it, or Claude does when a new task comes up while building | Advice first: the problem behind the idea, the strongest counter-argument, alternatives (including not building it) and one recommendation → write-up → your OK → a new file in `features/` (status **BACKLOG**) and its row in the index |
| `/prep-step` | Plan a task before building it | Sizes the feature (S, M or L) and specifies it to fit — acceptance criteria, edge cases, non-goals, tests, how it fits the project; may advise against it — then plans the substeps → specification and plan in the feature file (status **PLANNED**). If the task introduces a new framework, dependency, language or toolchain, checks the planned signals with the detection script against the fragment catalog and the stack modules — plus the catalog's characteristic triggers — and proposes appending missing catalog fragments, adding a missing module via `/choose-stack` (or keeping the language as a tool language), or, where the template has nothing for it (a tool without any module or fragment), building it by hand in the project — a project-local fragment or a hand-built toolchain — with an adoption proposal for the template, or declining the tool for good with a `tool:NAME` row. A fragment that also requires a change in the project itself brings that change into the plan |
| `/build-step` | Implement a planned task | Works the plan substep by substep, verifying each and reviewing its own diff (understandable, simple, secure, readable, no workaround) against `CODING-STANDARDS.md`; fixes bugs it finds in the code it touches (asks first when the fix is large); stops and offers ways forward instead of building a workaround; ends every substep with a `/step-done` recommendation |
| `/step-done` | After finishing a task/substep | Code review along five questions (understandable, simple, secure, readable, no workaround), fixing bugs it finds in the touched code → `just check` → independent review by a read-only reviewer agent with fresh context → detection backstop (a framework without its fragment, a language without its module or a tool the template has no convention for, new in this step) → managed-files backstop (a changed template file without a row in `.claude/convention-overrides.md` is reported, with the choice to register it, revert it or propose it for the template — never blocking) → secrets & privacy scan → preview of the booking (history entry, acceptance criteria with their proof, status, index) with the commit message → one approval → booking + commit |
| `/teach-step` | Implement it yourself, guided | Socratic guidance — you write all the code; Claude reads it, checks it along the same five questions as `/step-done`, points out bugs it finds as hints, gives graded hints, runs tests, writes nothing itself |
| `/audit-code` | One-off audit of existing code | Check (optionally scoped to an area or path) → results in AUDIT-RESULTS.md (gitignored) |

**Occasional project maintenance:**

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/choose-stack` | Add a stack module later, or switch modules — recommended from the project's signals, rendered from the template and merged three-way like an update, so your additions stay; the base snapshot follows. Composes the module's declared catalog fragments (append, idempotent per `fragment:NAME` marker) and can retrofit characteristic fragments after confirmation. Some fragments require more than the text in the slot — a file that has to exist before a framework first runs, say; that change is made in the same step and confirmed with it, and template files it changes are registered as `keep` |
| `/choose-license` | Pick or change the project license; in an existing project it also updates `.claude/template-answers` and the template files that depend on the license (e.g. `CONTRIBUTING.md`) |
| `/update-conventions` | Pull template updates into this project — downward only (template → project). Managed files are merged three-way against the base snapshot in `.claude/template-base/`: your additions stay, template changes arrive, only overlapping changes need a decision, and every result is confirmed per file; registered deviations follow their kind. Every run also detects what the project uses that the template now has a module or fragment for and offers it, and reports tools the template has no convention for, with an adoption proposal for the template (a copy-ready issue or prompt for the kit — nothing is sent); a permanent no becomes a `module:NAME`, `fragment:NAME` or `tool:NAME` row in the Rules table. Standards fragments and marked seed sections (`section:NAME`) are synced one by one; seed files are never replaced as a whole; project-local fragments are never touched, only reported with an adoption proposal for the template. Fragment requirements of that kind are re-checked even when the fragment text itself is unchanged — this is the only route that reaches a project which adopted a fragment before it carried the requirement. Without an argument it syncs this project; `status` only reports, `revise` reviews the deviation registry. `global` syncs the kit's global rules on this machine (`~/.claude/rules/coding-kit.md`: reply language, explanation level, house rules) section by section — every other run checks them once when they are set up |
| `/go-public` | Take a private or local-only project public, guided and fail-closed: blocking preflight audit (secrets across the full git history, privacy incl. commit metadata, license, `private/` hygiene), file catch-up **before** the switch (public-only files arrive while still private), then visibility change or repo creation + initial push only after explicit per-run approval |
| `/define-requirements` | Elicit requirements (M1 interview → goals, non-goals and constraints in the overview of `CLAUDE.md`, one feature file per core feature). The interview also asks the fragment catalog's characteristic triggers (e.g. audit-logging: "Are there user/admin actions that mutate data?") |
| `/refine-requirements` | Go back to the spec when something fundamental changed |

## Workflow 1: Intake a new task

```
You:    /add-feature <idea>
Claude: Analysis… recommendation… open questions…
You:    yes, do that
Claude: Writes it out, shows you the text
You:    looks good
Claude: Creates features/F-NNN-short-name.md, regenerates the index table and
        proposes a place in the recommended order
```

**Important:** Everything gets an F-number and its own file. No distinction between
"feature" and "task" — the `type` field only says whether it adds behaviour (`feature`),
fixes it (`fix`) or reworks something (`change`).
Claude may also start `/add-feature` itself — for an idea that comes up during
`/build-step`, say — but the entry is still written only after your OK.

---

## Workflow 2: Prepare, implement & finish a task

```
You:    /prep-step F-002
Claude: Size… questions… specification… substeps if needed (F-002a, F-002b, …)
You:    yes, write that in
Claude: Records specification and plan in the feature file (status PLANNED)
You:    /build-step F-002
Claude: Implements F-002a, verifies it, recommends /step-done
You:    /step-done
Claude: Review, checks, scans — then the booking and commit message as a preview
You:    book and commit
Claude: Booked and committed. Continue with F-002b?
```

Three skills, one per phase: `/prep-step` plans (→ `PLANNED`), `/build-step` implements the
plan substep by substep, `/step-done` reviews and finishes each substep. Prefer to write the
code yourself? Use `/teach-step` instead of `/build-step` — it guides you and writes nothing.

**Size:** three signals, the highest counts — effort (S under 5 files and 200 lines, M up
to 15 and 500, L above), uncertainty and reach. S gets a mini specification and no
substeps, M a short interview and 2–3 substeps, L the full interview and 3–5 substeps.
`/prep-step` without an argument takes the first feature of the recommended order.

## What `/step-done` does in detail

1. **Code review & checks** — changed files against `CODING-STANDARDS.md` (without it:
   the Mindset, Control flow and Secure coding sections of the kit's template), along five
   questions: understandable, simple, secure, readable (never minified), no workaround.
   Findings are fixed; a bug that was already in the touched code is fixed too, with a
   test, and noted in the history (large fixes only after asking). `just check` must be
   green. Then a **read-only reviewer agent** checks the diff with fresh context — it gets
   only the F-number, the diff, the new files and the coding standards, never a summary
   of the build — against the feature file (acceptance criteria, edge cases, non-goals)
   and the same five questions. Each finding is fixed or rejected with a reason; the list
   is shown with the booking preview. One run per step, no second round after the fixes.
2. **Secrets & privacy scan** — working tree + commit draft for secrets/keys/IPs/private
   emails; living docs for private info (names, customers, local paths). Findings are
   fixed or moved to `private/` before any commit is proposed.
3. **Detection backstop** — the detection script reports only the signals this step
   adds (new dependencies, tools, signal files). A framework without its standards
   fragment comes with a proposal to append it, a language without its stack module with
   the choice of `/choose-stack` or a tool language, a tool the template has no convention
   for with an adoption proposal for the template; a permanent no becomes a Rules row in
   `.claude/convention-overrides.md`. Non-blocking — it never stops the finish.
4. **Booking, as a preview** — the history entry of the substep in the feature file, its
   acceptance criteria checked off with their proof, the status (`IN-PROGRESS`, `DONE`
   after the last substep), the regenerated index table and, if needed, a change to the
   recommended order are prepared, not yet written.
5. **One approval for booking and commit** — the preview comes with a proposed
   Conventional Commits message; you choose *book and commit*, *book only*, or *change
   the text*. Only then are the feature file and `features/INDEX.md` written, `just check`
   re-run and the commit made (commit email verified as a GitHub noreply address).
6. **Graphiti** — only when the feature ends (`DONE`, `DROPPED` or `SUPERSEDED`): one
   short pointer episode in the knowledge graph (if configured).

## Important files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `features/INDEX.md` | Recommended order + the generated table of all features (`just features-index`) |
| `features/F-NNN-*.md` | One file per feature: intake, specification, plan, history |
| `features/F-000-template.md` | Template for a new feature file |
| `docs/adr/` | Decisions that shape the project beyond one feature |
| `CODING-STANDARDS.md` | Binding coding rules (incl. stack section) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project-specific Claude instructions (auto-loaded), incl. goals, non-goals and constraints in the overview |
| `.claude/convention-overrides.md` | Registered deviations from template conventions — why a managed file deviates and how updates treat it |
| `.claude/template-answers` | Values the template is rendered with for this project |
| `.claude/template-base/` | Base snapshot for template updates (generated — never edit) |
| `.claude/skills/` | Project-specific skills only (workflow skills come from the plugin) |

## Tips

- **Not everything at once.** Decompose large tasks via `/prep-step`.
- **`/step-done` after each substep** — otherwise details get lost in the docs.
- **Claude never commits automatically.** You are always asked — and no feature file or index
  change is written without your OK either.
- **Languages:** see the Languages block in `CLAUDE.md` — living docs in
  {{LANG_LIVING_DOCS}}, code comments in {{LANG_COMMENTS}}, commit prose in
  {{LANG_COMMITS}} (Conventional-Commit tokens stay English); identifiers and
  governance docs are always English.
- **Secrets/private info** belong in `private/` (gitignored), never in the tree.
- **On errors:** fix diagnostics immediately — no workarounds, always the root cause.
