# Convention Overrides

<!-- section:overrides-head -->
Registry of deliberate, project-local deviations from the template conventions.
`/update-conventions` merges template updates into managed files three-way, so a project
addition survives without a row here. A row records **why** a file deviates and how
updates treat it — the Kind column:

- `skip` — the file is never created, changed or offered (e.g. no CI in a local-only
  project).
- `keep` — template changes still merge in; on a conflict the project side wins.
- `adapt` — the file carries spots concretised for this project (`template:adapt`).
- empty — merged normally; the row only documents the reason.

`/step-done` reports changes to managed files that have no row. Paths may be globs
(`.github/**`); several paths can share a row. Deviations that are not about one file go
to the Rules table. Inside a seed zone or a standards fragment, a line that holds nothing
but an HTML comment starting with `override:` and the reason protects just that part.

A Rules row with the Rule `module:NAME` or `fragment:NAME` declines a detection proposal
for good: the skills stop offering that stack module or standards fragment. The Deviation
column says what the project does instead — e.g. Python as a tool language with a
hand-built toolchain instead of the python module. `tool:NAME` does the same for a tool
the template has no convention for: the skills stop proposing it to the template.

Since is the date a row was added (`YYYY-MM-DD`).

A deviation needs a reason — "we never got around to it" is drift, not a deviation.
